Configuration
=============
+ The basic pattern to call the transfer scripts are as follows;

        <path_to_jar>/transfer.jar $direction $partner

        // Use this to transfer both directions for all partners
        example: E:/AEG/scritps/transfer.jar

        // Use this to transfer both directions for CleaResult
        example: E:/AEG/scritps/transfer.jar both cr

        // Use this to transfer inbound directions for AEG
        example: E:/AEG/scritps/transfer.jar in aeg

The 2 variables that can be dynamically changed;
+ direction ( defaults to both)
+ partner-name (defaults to non which means all)

If you do not pass a variable for either the scripts defaults to both directions for all partners.
